Virtual Treeview is a Delphi treeview control built from ground up. Many years of development 
made it one of the most flexible and advanced tree controls available today. 
Virtual Treeview starts off with the claim to improve many aspects of existing 
solutions and introduces some new technologies and principles which were not available before.
